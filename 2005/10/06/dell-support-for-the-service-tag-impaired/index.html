<p>If you have a Dell product with no service tag, and you need support, expect to spend a long time on the phone.</p>
<p>I bought a Dell 2001FP LCD monitor on 2005/2/17.  A few days ago, it broke.  Specifically, about 20 black lines now run down the center of the display, with a few pixels between each.  These lines show up even in the self-test screen, so it's definitely a problem in the monitor.</p>
<p><img style ='float:right' src="http://static.flickr.com/30/50127802_286195b46e_o.jpg" alt="Close Up of Broken Monitor" width="400" height="319" /></p>
<p>You can see the lines running across the image on the right.  They run horizontally in the image because I've got the monitor rotated 90°.  The problem is much more apparent in real life.  It's difficult to photograph (at least with my crappy camera).</p>
<p>I quickly discovered that you cannot get on-line support unless you have a product with a service tag (a short unique string like a serial number).  Dell monitors don't have service tags.  If you have the monitor connected to a Dell computer, you can use the computer's service tag.  My monitor is connected to my Apple PowerBook.</p>
<p>My only option was to call Dell tech support.  The number wasn't easy to find, either.  I found it on <a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/policy/en/policy?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~section=010">the warranty page</a>, which was also not as easy to find as it should have been.</p>
<p>As you might expect, this was followed by a total of about 30 minutes on hold.  They have promised to ship me a new monitor, and it should arrive Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
