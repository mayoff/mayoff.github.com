<p>We saw <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> on Sunday.  Spider-pig was the funniest bit.  There were some other funny bits, but it didn't have the humor density of a typical 30-minute episode.</p>
<p>Watching <em>The Simpsons</em> in a theater with strangers of varying ages was interesting.  The twelve-year-olds laughed loudly at all of the tired old jokes I got sick of twenty years ago.  I guess that's why Hollywood keeps putting them in.  Many of the bits I found funniest didn't seem to get much of a reaction from the rest of the theater.</p>
<p>Also, strangely, people kept wandering in to the movie for about 30 minutes after it started.  Fortunately the theater was pretty empty so they didn't have to make a big fuss finding a seat.</p>
