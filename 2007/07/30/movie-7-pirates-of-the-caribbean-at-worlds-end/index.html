<p>We saw <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</em> on Saturday.  I liked it.  John didn't.  He thought the plot was too complex, and he didn't care about the characters.  I thought the plot was just right, and although I didn't care much about the characters either, the plot was interesting enough to make up for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we were sitting in front of some loud-mouthed retards.  We probably will not be going to the south Tinseltown again.  It seems to attract that sort of cretin.</p>
<p>Delia and Todd like to assign numeric ratings to movies.  I don't think that it's possible to assign just one rating to a movie.  The problem, as I pointed out on Saturday, is that sometimes you're in the mood for a certain type of movie, and other times you're not.  When you're not in the mood, you won't like the movie as much.  I felt vindicated on Sunday when John admitted that he might have been overly harsh about the movie because he wasn't really in the mood for an action/adventure film on Saturday.</p>
